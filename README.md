# AutoFramework
Try to build AI tool for Minecraft architectures.


The author isn't experienced neither in AI nor Java and Python, so the framework is not very good. I will try to improve it in the future.
Seggestions are sincerely welcomed.

# Description
This project is a model for building Minecraft architectures automatically. It aims to help single players save time and effort to build houses.
Hopefully, an agent can help validate vague ideas and save time when doing huge costructions by filling the samilar structures automatically.
As the registry of Minecraft blocks is huge, only the most common building blocks are surpported in this project.

# TODO
As you can see, the project is still in the early stage with ideas and ambitions. The following tasks are planned to be done in the future:
- [] Transform the worlds to Numpy ndarrays for later training.
- [] set up a transformer model and trian it on data in the first step.
- [] Build a Mod for Minecraft(may be Neoforge?) to gaining data when the game is running and make respond to the model.
